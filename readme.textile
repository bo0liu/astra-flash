h1. Astra Flash Components

Forked by Josh Tynjala from Astra Flash 1.4. Originally developed by Yahoo! Inc.

Since Yahoo! has officially deprecated the Astra Flash components, I created this fork to keep the source available in the event that Yahoo! chooses to remove the project from their developer portal.

Please note: Although I was an original developer involved with the Astra projects when I worked at Yahoo! between 2006 and 2008, I have no current plans for maintaining or adding to these components.
